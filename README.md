Snake Game
![Game snapshot](<Game Screenshot.png>)

One of my old projects I coded when I was around 13. Enjoy!

Here is the game known by all programmers: Snake! Double click on the game field to switch to full screen mode or to leave it. To control the game use the WASD or arrow keys. The goal is to eat as many apples as possible without crashing into the wall or into yourself. But beware: the more apples you eat, the longer you get and the harder it is to avoid crashing into the wall or yourself! After a test game you can determine the difficulty (speed) yourself.
